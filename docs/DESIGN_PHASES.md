# Design Phases

## Development Workflow

This prototype follows a three-phase iterative design process:

### Phase 1: Initial Context & Generation
**What happens:** You provide research, references, and context about what needs to be built. Claude generates the initial implementation based on that research.

**Focus:**
- Understanding requirements and user needs
- Researching design patterns and best practices
- Establishing technical foundation
- Generating initial component structure

**Output:**
- Working code based on research
- Component structure and patterns
- Basic functionality implemented

---

### Phase 2: Fix Functional & UX Issues
**What happens:** Verify all interactions work correctly and resolve any functional or user experience problems.

**Focus:**
- Making all interactions work (drag-and-drop, editing, etc.)
- Fixing broken functionality
- Addressing usability issues
- Ensuring intuitive user flows
- Edge case handling
- State management corrections

**Current Known Issues:**
- ⚠️ Section reordering not working
- ⚠️ Field reordering within sections not working
- ⚠️ Field movement between sections not working

**Checklist:**
- [ ] All drag-and-drop behavior works
- [ ] Inline editing functions properly
- [ ] Add/delete operations work
- [ ] Expand/collapse behavior is correct
- [ ] State updates correctly
- [ ] No broken interactions
- [ ] Edge cases handled

---

### Phase 3: Fix UI & Visual Polish
**What happens:** After functionality is solid, refine the visual design and polish the interface.

**Focus:**
- Spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy refinement
- Animation and transition polish
- Design system compliance
- Micro-interactions
- Responsive behavior
- Visual consistency
- Accessibility improvements

**Activities:**
- Adjust spacing for better visual rhythm
- Refine hover states and transitions
- Ensure theme token compliance
- Polish empty states
- Improve visual feedback
- Responsive design testing

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Spacing follows design system
- [ ] Typography is consistent
- [ ] Colors use theme tokens correctly
- [ ] Animations are smooth
- [ ] Hover states are polished
- [ ] Visual hierarchy is clear
- [ ] Responsive across breakpoints
- [ ] Accessibility standards met

## Design Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Phase |
|------|----------|-----------|-------|
| 2025-10-02 | Use `isSystem` boolean instead of `variant` enum | More accurately reflects data model | Phase 1 |
| 2025-10-02 | Section accepts `children` prop | Provides flexibility and composition | Phase 1 |
| 2025-10-02 | Add Field button is auto-width | Gives breathing room, de-emphasizes secondary action | Phase 1 |
| 2025-10-02 | Empty section shows "Add or Drag Fields here" | Clear affordance for empty state | Phase 1 |
| 2025-10-02 | System sections show chip badge | Visual distinction from custom sections | Phase 1 |
| 2025-10-02 | System sections cannot be deleted | Prevents accidental deletion | Phase 1 |
| 2025-10-02 | Fixed drawer with independent scrolling | Better UX for long content | Phase 1 |
