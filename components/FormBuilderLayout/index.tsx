/**
 * Form Builder Layout Components
 *
 * Shared layout components for form builder versions
 * Exports all styled components and layout utilities
 *
 * UX PRINCIPLES APPLIED:
 * - Jakob's Law: Familiar three-panel layout (drawer-content-inspector) like Figma, VS Code
 * - Fitts's Law: Large touch targets (44x44px) for all interactive elements
 * - Visual Hierarchy: Clear separation of field library, canvas, and preview controls
